## Hi
> Congratulations ðŸŽŠ on getting to this point, which means you are interested in learning react native.

### 1. There are two paths to take in React Native
> `CLI` stands for Command Line Interface ~ basically Command prompt stuff ðŸ˜†

| Expo Go CLI   | React Native CLI  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Beginner Friendly     | Pro react native developers | 
| Easy to setup      | Alot of work      |   
| Easy to test on all devices | only simulators and wire connection can be used     | 
| About 80% control ~which is more than enough for a start | 100% control of app    |

#### You can learn more with this [`link`]([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?package-manager=npm&guide=quickstart)https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?package-manager=npm&guide=quickstart)

### 2. Download and install [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en)
> Choose the LTS download for windows

---
### 3. Setup using EXPO GO

a. Visit [`expo`](https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?package-manager=npm&guide=quickstart)https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?package-manager=npm&guide=quickstart),setup your account and create a new project.


b. copy the command in the `create a new project` open and paste it into your command prompt
> Please copy the code first, before you accidentally close it okay, you won't get it back unless you delete and recreate a new project ðŸ˜†

c. Once successful, in the command prompt, type
```
code .
```
> To open the project in [`VScode`](https://code.visualstudio.com/), the best editor for react native

d. Open the terminal in VScode and type
```
expo start
```
Download the  `Expo Go` app on playstore or appStore, log in and you will find the project you created waiting for you there.
