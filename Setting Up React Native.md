## Hi
> Congratulations on getting to this point, which means you are interested in learning react native.

### 1. There are two paths to take in React Native
> `CLI` stands for Command Line Interface ~ basically Command prompt stuff ðŸ˜†

| Expo Go CLI   | React Native CLI  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Beginner Friendly     | Pro react native developers | 
| Easy to setup      | Alot of work      |   
| Easy to test on all devices | only simulators and wire connection can be used     | 
| About 80% control ~which is more than enough for a start | 100% control of app    |
